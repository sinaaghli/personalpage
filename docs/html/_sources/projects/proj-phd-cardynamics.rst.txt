Dynamic Modeling of AWD CAR
============================
I am fascinated by Bond-Graphs and how capable they are, They are a graph representation of dynamics/kinematics and they work for electrical, mechanical and even chemical systems. 

if you are familiar with mass-spring-damper system dynamics, this is how a bond graph for that system looks like,

    :width: 600
    :align: center

very simple right? one connection node in the middle and four other elements. 

I used similar techniques to extract a detailed model for an all wheel drive car, the graph looks like

.. image:: ../media/bond-car.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

and lateral and longitudinal friction models can be drawn as (based on stribeck friction model)

    :width: 600
    :align: center

and eventually you can use a software package to convert the graph to analytical equations (I used 20Sim). one could simpy write a solver themselves.

    :align: center

Runnig some simulations of this ODE gives reasonable trajectories for the vehicle. Here is a simulation of one equilibrium point on the equilibrium manifold

    :align: center

I calculated some slices of equilibrium manifold for using linear and non-linear tire model

.. image:: ../media/slice1.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

.. image:: ../media/slice2.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

.. image:: ../media/slice3.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

results were consistend with `this paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.1530.pdf>`_

You can find a c++ implementation of mentione ODE `here <https://github.com/arpg/spirit/blob/feature/rk4/include/spirit/CarODE.h>`_
