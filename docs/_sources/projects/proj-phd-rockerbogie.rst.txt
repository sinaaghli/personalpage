Rocker Bogie Platform Dummy Test
==================================
At the end my PhD studies ARPG labs (Team Marble) was selected to compete at DARPA Grand Challenge where autonomous robots explore undergroud tonnels.
Even though I was involved for a short period but still while deciding for mobile robot platform I created a demo rocker boggie platform in a period of 2-3 days to try it in action.
Very simple project but it was super fun to watch it go over obstacles.
