Vision based Pistachio classification
=======================================

Vision based Pistachio classification for ultra high speed sorting machine. I only worked on recognition algorithm, a traditional feature extraction and SVM was able to classify nuts from their shell with 85% accuracy.

I unfortunetly don't have any videos of the project.
