Parkour Car: An Autonomous car Platform
========================================
I did lots of hardware designs during my PhD but Parkour Car has been the running platform which I was continiously updating.

Features of Parkour Car

* Intel core i7 (4core) pc with NVidia graphics on board
* Dual sterio cameras (2MP each)
* 1024 ppr custom designed optical encoders in each wheel
* All wheel drive
* Front and back wheel steering
* 9 Dof IMU
* Custom ECU board to interface computer with hardware
* Custom software driver for communicating with the robot over USB
* BLDC motor with FoC
* BLDC auto thermal shutdown for safe operation
* Wifi communication with external computers (mostly for Vicon feedback)

All Designs are in numerous repositories under `ARPG Lab's Github <https://github.com/arpg>`_

* `Hardware drivers <https://github.com/arpg/HAL>`_
* `Encoder PCB <https://github.com/arpg/NINJA-WheelEncoder>`_
* `ECU PCB <https://github.com/arpg/NINJA-ECU>`_
* `ECU Firmware <https://github.com/arpg/NINJA-ECU-Firmware>`_

Here are some videos of the robot
