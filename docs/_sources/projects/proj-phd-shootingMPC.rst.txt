Shooting MPC on Parkour Car
============================
A faster sampling based MPC implementation of my Physics Engine in the loop controller. In this controlelr given current state of the robot, physics engine model is initialized and control inputs are sampled to generate trajectories of robot in a pre-defined horizon. A discrete cost function then chooses which control sample is desirable and applies that control to the robot.

this controller was then tested with my parkour car platform on different surface material with different friction coefficient.
The controller locally stable (more extensive discussion on in my thesis) around a given trajectory.
