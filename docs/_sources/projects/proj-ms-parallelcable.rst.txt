Parallel Cable Manipulator
===========================

For my masters thesis I designed a parallel cable manipulator. 
The control algorithm basically consisted of openloop kinematics based calculation of actuator trajecotries and an LQR controller on each join.
All parts of the project mechanical design, pcb design, firmware and software was done by myself in a period of one semester.
